This project was inspired by some challenges i had during carbonation of my pressure fermented lagers.
Some reading on "fully spunding" the beer, reaching final carbonation level expressed in the volumes of co2 per volume of beer inspired me
to test if i could fully carbonate beer using only the co2 made by the yeast during fermentation.

Most of the resources availiable on carbonation of beer assume you have a flat beer, with exact numbers rarely beeing thrown around for the "quick" carbonation methods floating around
OR! provide the equilibrium pressure required for slow gradual equilibrium in the fluids to reach that carbonation over a couple of weeks.

It would seem larger breweries use weight rather than temperature and pressure over time, allowing for far higher pressures and faster dispersion of the CO2 in the liquid using
the weight of CO2 transferred from the canister to the beer tank instead.

To use that method, you need to know the existing weight of CO2 in the tank, which i hope this calculator will eventually solve.
I am using Henry's law to calculate the amount of CO2 left in the beer after spunding to decide how much to add externally at the maximum pressure my fermentation vessel can hold.
I am not including the amount of CO2 headpressure for this calculator.

Some of the reading and resources i've used for the project so far:
